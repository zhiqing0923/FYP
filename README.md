# Fully Automatic System for Accurate Localisation and Analysis of Cephalometric Landmarks in Lateral Cephalograms and Evaluation of Automated Cephalometric Analysis Based on AI Techniques Compared to Computer-Assisted Manual Analysis

Lateral cephalometry has long been integral to orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. It not only elucidates dentofacial morphology and the anatomical underpinnings of malocclusion but also tracks growth patterns in the craniofacial complex. Hence, precise localization of cephalometric landmarks is crucial for orthodontists. Traditionally, manual tracing has been the norm for cephalometric analysis, but while it saves time, it does little to enhance accuracy.
Recent years have witnessed a surge in artificial intelligence (AI) studies aimed at automating landmark identification in cephalometry. AI-driven landmark detection surpasses traditional methods in terms of repeatability and efficiency. Yet, despite comparisons between human and AI-based analyses, the diverse automated cephalometric software remains to be thoroughly assessed in orthodontic practice.

Furthermore, few studies have comprehensively evaluated both cephalometric landmarks and measurements. This study meticulously assesses the accuracy of landmarks and measurements pertaining to bone, teeth, and soft tissue, aiming to unveil the broader potential of AI-driven cephalometric analysis in clinical settings. The project aims to develop and appraise the precision of automatic cephalometric landmark localization and measurements through AI, contrasting them with computer-assisted manual analysis.
